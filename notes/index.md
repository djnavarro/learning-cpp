title: "Notes on learning C++"
---

These pages contain the notes I've been writing for myself as I work through [*Professional C++ (5th edition)*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Professional+C%2B%2B%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781119695400) by Marc Gregoire. They aren't intended to serve as a tutorial on C++. That's what the book is for! I'm writing these notes because I learn best when I write my own code and take notes as I go. Making my notes-to-self public is a useful way to force myself not to take bad shortcuts. It's not meant to be anything more than that! The repository for these notes is [github.com/djnavarro/learning-cpp](https://github.com/djnavarro/learning-cpp). Caveat emptor, and all that :)
